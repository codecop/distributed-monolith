# Distributed Monolith Service 'Kafka'

This is an [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) broker.

## Running it locally

You can run it with the exec maven plugin like this:

```
cd kafka
../mvnw compile exec:java
```

Or you can run it from your IDE. As it needs to format its data storage, you need to start it twice.

Kafka is listening on `PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092` and its controller on `localhost:9093`.
